# EzGM 

Toolbox for ground motion record selection and processing. 

***
### The repository is deprecated for now

The repository is deprecated for now as the [Djura team](https://www.djura.it/company/our-team) has made significant changes in the EzGM toolbox. The collaborative efforts being made resulted in brand new tools such as Djura - record selector ([see demo](https://www.djura.it/playground)). Some of the new features of these tools include:

- Selection of records using a web application with a graphical user interface (GUI).
- Computation of new intensity measures (IMs) such as filtered incremental velocity, FIV3.
- Selection of ground motion records for more than six different seismic codes.
- Optimized code-based ground motion selection.
- Usability of generalized conditional intensity measure approach (GCIM), with adoption to new IMs such as FIV3.
- Computation of exact conditional spectrum.

The finalized tools will be released soon along with the training videos. Feel free to contact me for further information.
