### The repository is deprecated for now

The repository is deprecated for now as the [Djura](https://www.djura.it/company/our-team) team has made significant changes in the EzGM toolbox. The significant improvements made resulted in brand new tools such as [Djura record-selector](https://www.djura.it/playground). Some of the new features of these tools include:

- It is now possible to select records using a web application with a graphical user interface (GUI).
- It is now possible to compute other newer intensity measures (IMs) such as filtered incremental velocity, FIV3.
- It is now possible to select ground motion records for more than six different seismic codes.
- Code-based ground motion selection procedures are optimized.
- Generalized conditional intensity measure approach (GCIM) is introduced, adapting to new IMs such as FIV3.
- Exact computation of conditional spectrum is now possible.

Soon the finalized products will be released along with the training videos. Feel free to contact me for further information.
